# Bouncing Balls Game

This is a programming assignment for the class CSCI 1951U taught at Brown University.

Included in this repository are my self-written project requirements and specifications.

## How to Play

To launch this program you will need to run `Main.class`.

Once things are running, here are the rules!
- On first launch you will see several shapes on screen. Click on one to start that corresponding level!
- Once you are in a level, you will see an enemy/"boss" in the middle-top of the screen. Hit the enemy with the yellow triangles that are fired from around your cursor! Once the the HP in the title of the window reaches 0, you win!
- Be careful! If any of the bullets spawned by the enemy touch the red area around your mouse, that's game over for you!
